# Lab 1: TensorFlow Basics

**TensorFlow** is an open source software library for numerical computation using **data flow graphs**.

### What is a Data Flow Graph?
- Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations
- Edges represent the multidimensional data arrays(tensors) communicated between them.

## Installation

make virtual environment -> pip upgrade -> pip install tensorflow

## Hello, World!

- Everything is operation!
